			"1. Generate interactive novel chapter content, strictly maintaining the original character names (e.g., Sophia/Dylan)",
			"2. Each choice branch must: a) be logically coherent b) advance the main plot c) provide a unique emotional experience (choose one from tension/temptation/sadness)",
			"3. Non-final chapters must end with a choice item containing 3 options; final chapters must not",
			"4. Options must be randomly generated (no fixed pattern) and affect: changes in character relationships, key plot twists, ending branches",
			"5. Each chapter gradually reveals: one clue about the protagonist's identity, one emotional conflict, one progress in the revenge plan",
			"6. For the first appearance of a new character: female characters must include appearance descriptions (e.g., 'her red lips slightly parted'), male characters highlight temperament characteristics",
			"7. Language requirements: a) The Count of Monte Cristo-style ornate metaphors b) Bourne Identity-style suspenseful pacing c) emotional conflicts visualized",
			"8. Insert environmental descriptions/detailed foreshadowing (e.g., suspicious items, memory flashes) every 3-4 dialogue segments"
