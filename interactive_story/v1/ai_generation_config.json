		"rules": [
			"1. The chapter content must conform to the following main - line advancement logic: a) The protagonist gradually uncovers the mystery of their life experience; b) The emotional relationship evolves gradually; c) The revenge plan is gradually implemented, with the rhythm advancing layer by layer.",
			"2. Strictly control the appearance rhythm of key characters: Villains or important forces must not appear in their true identities in Chapters 1 - 2; their first appearance should be in a suspenseful way (only hearing their names/describing them indirectly).",
			"3. The relationship - building among all characters must progress reasonably: They should not directly trust or conspire upon first meeting. A relationship chain must be gradually established through event - driven means (such as experiencing danger together).",
			"4. Each chapter must contain the following elements: a) A **new clue** related to the main line (about the protagonist's past or the villain); b) An **emotional conflict** (misunderstanding/attraction/contradiction); c) A step of **revenge progress** (planning/probing/trial - and - error).",
			"5. Between every 3 - 4 dialogues, at least one of the following should be interspersed: a) Environmental descriptions to enhance the atmosphere (rainy night, bloodstains, details of an old house, etc.); b) Foreshadowing props or details (a torn letter, vague memory fragments); c) The protagonist's inner monologue (puzzlement, anger, desire, etc.).",
			"6. Descriptions of characters' first appearance: a) Female characters should include descriptions of their appearance and temperament (e.g., 'Her red lips parted slightly, and unease was hidden between her brows and eyes'); b) Male characters should highlight their aura, tone of voice, or behavioral characteristics (e.g., 'He stood in the backlight, and his voice was as cold as a blade').",
			"7. Rules for generating branch options: a) Generate 3 branches at the end of each chapter (non - final chapters), with the order being random; b) Each branch triggers a different emotional experience (fear/sadness/temptation/anger); c) The branches need to affect: changes in interpersonal relationships, the direction of the main - line progress, and the plot development.",
			"8. Rhythm of dialogue and narrative language: a) Imitate the metaphorical rhetoric of *The Count of Monte Cristo* to create an exquisite sense of language; b) Imitate the rhythmic tension of *The Bourne Identity* to strengthen the suspense - building; c) Emotional expressions need to be visualized, for example, 'Her hands were trembling, but her eyes were as firm as ice'.",
			"9. The development of side - lines must follow the main line: Non - main - line characters/events must not forcibly seize the rhythm; side - line tasks must serve the main line (such as triggering main - line clues or emotional changes).",
			"10. Logical jumps are prohibited: Any major behavior of a character (such as trust, betrayal, action) must be based on the foreshadowing in the previous text, and the motivation for the behavior must be reasonably expressed.",
			"11. The title of each chapter should be concrete, engaging, and imply the chapter's theme emotion or key event.",
			"12. Each character should possess the following basic elements: a) A background secret or desire (i.e., an invisible motivation); b) A contrast between the surface character and the true character; c) At least one value - based decision (taking sides, betrayal, sacrifice) in the main line.",
			"13. All dialogues must have a character's purpose, and 'pointless small talk' is not allowed; each sentence of dialogue should reflect the character's emotional changes, strategic tendencies, or hidden intentions.",
			"14. When an important character makes their second appearance after the first one, they should show a contrast different from the first impression (for example, a seemingly cold - hearted person suddenly shows tenderness, or a friendly person shows a strong desire for control).",
			"15. Each chapter must contain at least one description of 'non - verbal actions', such as detailed micro - expressions (biting lips, finger trembling), physical reactions (taking half a step back, avoiding eye contact), etc., to reflect the character's inner fluctuations.",
			"16. Set up a 'dark - side hint mechanism': When the protagonist approaches an important clue, insert surreal elements such as visual or auditory hallucinations (such as a person's phantom, the sound of a bell, an old photo frame falling) as omens.",
			"17. Strengthen the consistency of the narrative perspective: The whole story must be told from the protagonist's perspective only. Do not switch perspectives to describe the inner thoughts of other characters. Other characters can only be presented through the protagonist's observation, speculation, comparison, etc.",
			"18. The protagonist's behavior must be influenced by their background - no behavior should be 'out of character'. That is, when the protagonist makes a key choice, it must reflect their background setting, psychological trauma, or emotional motivation (such as avoiding something due to childhood fear, etc.).",
			"19. All major plot nodes (such as achieving trust, information leakage, intimate contact) must be based on the 'three - step foreshadowing method': 1) Initial hint; 2) Guide the reader's expectations; 3) Realize or reverse the expectations.",
			"20. The impact of branch options must be 'traceable', that is: When generating chapters, the AI must consider the influence of previous options and reflect the changed world state (character attitudes, environmental conditions, degree of intelligence acquisition, etc.) in subsequent chapters.",
			"21. Each chapter must contain a small detail (props/statements/scene elements) that can be overlooked but'reused'. This detail can be awakened as a key puzzle - solving element in future chapters.",
			"22. Strengthen the 'choice - cost mechanism': Each option should have a balance of 'gains' and 'losses' in cost. Avoid having all options be positive rewards. Some should trigger unexpected side - effects or emotional distress.",
			"23. There must be a potential competitive/linking relationship among female supporting characters similar to the female lead, creating tension in the emotional sub - plot (such as bonds/envy/misunderstandings), but they should not overshadow the protagonist's role.",
			"24. If the story background setting includes organizations/gangs/companies, etc., a complete ecosystem must be gradually constructed, including names, ranks, codes, rules, passwords, etc., and it should be gradually unfolded in the chapters."
